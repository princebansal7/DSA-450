<summary>Bubble Sort (In-place and Stable sorting algorithm)</summary>

        1.Swaps adjacent elements only if a[i]>a[i+1] => keeps the order same as
          original array => Stable sorting algo
        2.After each pass, largest element bubbled up to the top that's why called Bubble sort !!
        3.Adaptive and Stable sorting algo
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Modified Bubble Sort (In-place and Stable sorting algorithm)</summary>
  
       - Here, we maintain a variable in each pass, if given array is sorted or became sorted
         midway, if simply stops the loop and enhances performance.
         => if Given Array sorted => TC: O(n)
            otherwise            => TC: O(n^2)
</details>

<details>
  <summary> Selection Sort (In-place and Unstable sorting algorithm)</summary>

        1.Idea is, find out the minimum element and put at the 1st position, 2nd min at 2nd pos and
        repeat the process till end => order of elements can be changed=> Unstable sorting algo

        2.Does less memory writes compare to all other sorting algorithms
        3.But not an Optimal algo in term of memory writes, Cycle sort is more optimal in term   of memory writes
        4.TC: O(N^2) for all cases
        5.Base fot Heap Sort
        1. Non Adaptive and Unstable sorting algo
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary> Insertion Sort (In-place and Stable sorting algorithm)</summary>

        1.Idea is, we maintain 2 parts,
            a. Sorted Part
            b. Unsorted Part

        We 'insert' the current element to sorted part at it's "correct position" and make the
        sorted part bigger in each pass.

        2.1st element is single in sorted part initially => we directly starts from the 2nd element

        3.Best and Most Efficient when Array size is Small (TimSort and IntroSort)
        4.TC: theta(N^2) for Worst Case (When given array is reverse sorted, because maximum shifting happens)
        5.TC: theta(N) for Best Case (When given array is already Sorted)
        6.In General- TC: O(N^2)
        7.Adaptable and Stable algo
</details>
<details>
   <summary>Merge Sort</summary>

      1. Divide and Conquer and Merge
      2. Stable Algo => Maintains Order of Original equal items
      3. TC: O(N(logN)), SC: O(N)
      4. Not InPlace ALgo but Variants like Block merge sort algo take SC:O(1) and TC: O(N(logN))
      5. Well suited for External Sorting
      6. Quick Sort out performs Merge sort in case of Arrays
      Prerequisite: You should know How Merge Two Sorted Arrays.

   <summary>Partitioning Logics</summary>
   <blockquote>

      1. Naive Partition [Stable] (slowest)
   
      2. Lomuto Partition [Unstable]
   
      3. Haore Partition [Unstable]  (fastest: 3 times faster than Lomuto's) 
  <details>
   <summary>Naive Partition</summary>

      - Understanding Naive Partition [Stable]
            1. Here we have an array and index of pivot element
            2. we'll put all the smaller or equal values to the left side of pivot.
            3. then, we'll put pivot element at it's correct position
            4. then we'll put all the greater elements to right of pivot
            5. finally we'll return the index of last occurrence of pivot element. (last occurrence for the case
               when have multiple same elements)

            eg: I/P: arr = [3,6,12,10,7], p = 5 (pivot element index => 7 is pivot)

               =>    [3,6,7,12,10]  (not necessary that left, right part of pivot will be in sorted order)
                           or
                     [6,3,7,12,10]
                           or
                      ...........
               O/P: 2 (new pivot element i.e, 7's index)

            eg: I/P: arr = [2,7,8,3,7], p = 1
                => [2,3,7,7,8]
                O/P: 3 (index of last occurrence of pivot)
      
      
  </details>

   <summary>Lomuto's Partition</summary>

   - Requires only 1 traversal => TC: O(N)
   - Requires Constant Extra Space => SC: O(1)

    WORKING:
        1. Here Also we are given array, low, high index as input
        2. Unlike Naive partition where we get pivot element's index as input,
           in Lomuto partition we always consider Last element as our Pivot element. ( will also
           see what to do if not last element is pivot)
        3. 1st we traverse array from low to high-1 (as High is pivot element, so before that)
        4. If element is smaller than pivot, increase window size of smaller elements by swapping (see in code)

        NOTE: (Handling case when pivot is not last element)

        - if custom pivot element is given, then we simply swap that pivot with last element
          and implement the lomuto Partition in similar manner.

   <summary>Hoare's Partition</summary>

   - Requires only 1 traversal => TC: O(N)
   - Requires Constant Extra Space => SC: O(1)

    WORKING:
        1. Here Also we are given array, low, high index as input
        2. Unlike Naive partition where we get pivot element's index as input,
           in Hoare's partition we always consider 1st element as our Pivot element. ( will also
           see what to do if not last element is pivot)
        3. we use two pointer i (low-1), j (high+1)
        4. we move i and j such that, i stops when element is greater or equal to pivot element
           and j stops when element is less than the pivot element, then if i and j didn't cross each other
           then we simply swaps the current arr[i] and arr[j] otherwise we return j (index of last occurrence
           of pivot element)
        5. This Algo ensures that elements on the left side are smaller or equal to elements on the right side
        6. You'll observe that elements from low to j are smaller and j+1 to high are greater => we successfully partitioned the array

        NOTE 1:
              - Difference b/w Lomuto and Hoare partition is, in Lomuto it puts the pivot at it's correct position
                but in Hoare it doesn't put the pivot at it's correct position rather it just returns the index where
                it should be if placed at correct position.

              - So that's where lomuto partition is takes edge from Hoare's as it sorts that pivot element during partitioning
              - Then why Hoare's partition is better ? it takes less number of comparisons so on avaerage works better than
                lomuto's partition

        NOTE 2: (Handling case when pivot is not last element)

        - if custom pivot element is given, then we simply swap that pivot with last element
          and implement the hoare Partition in similar manner.

<summary>Quick Sort</summary>

    - Divide and Conquer Algo
    - Worst time complexity: O(N^2)
    - Despite O(N^2) TC, It is Considered faster due to he following:
      1. In-Place (ignoring recursion call stack)
      2. Cache Friendly
      3. Average case TC: O(N.logN)
      4. Tail recursion (recursive call is made at last)
    - Partition function is the key function (Naive (for stable), Lomuto , Hoare (for efficiency, generally used))
    - sort() in STL use Intro sort (hybrid of heap, insertion, quick sort)
    - When stability is not required Quick sort is best
    - When stability required Merge sort used
   
    - Analysis on Quick Sort (Hoare's partition used generally):

        1. Time Complexity:
     
          - Best case: Input array gets divided into two halves, pivot becomes middle element value vise: TC: O(N.logN)
          - Average case: O(N.logN)
          - Worst case: when partition function parts the array such that it have 1 element on one side and n-1 elements on another side: TC: O(N^2)
    
        2. Space Complexity:
     
           - Mostly it's said that Quick sort is In-Place but it's arguable, if by **in-place is defined as an algo which takes constant extra space**, then Quick Sort is definitely not 'In-Place', the partition function of quick sort is in-place if Hoare's or Lomuto's partitioning is used.
           - If you are considering Quick sort as an algorithm, then it requires extra space for Recursion
             call stack.
           - **In-Place Algo 2nd definition:** if your algorithm is *not copying input elements to an auxillary space then this algo is in-place, so by this definition Quick Sort is In-place as it doesn't copy the input elements to another space, it only needs the extra space for reclusion call stack.
           - Quick is "Tail Recursive" (read in Recursion folder)
           - Space required in recursion call stack (In Lomuto's or Hoare's):
              - Worst Case: theta(N)
              - Best Case: O(logN) (As height in case of equal parts is: O(logN))
    
        3. Choice of Pivot in Worst case in Quick Sort:
            
            - Lomuto's partition picks the **Last element** as *pivot*
            - Hoare's partition picks the **First element** as *pivot*
            - So, when given array is already sorted then, Both the Partition algo will goes into the *Worst Case* 
            - So, if we are writing the sort function for Standard library then, for the users who give always sorted array as input, our sort function will works slower => this situation is called **Advisory analysis**, as we don't want a situation where our algorithm fails.
            - So, in practical implementation a random function is used to generate a random pivot 
            
            ``pivotIndex = low + (rand() % high)`` 
    
            - we already know how to handle the case for random pivot in case of Lomuto and Hoare's partitions

   <summary>Tail Recursion [ <a href="/Basic-Concepts/Recursion/5.TailRecursion.cpp" target="_blank">Code1,</a> <a href="/Basic-Concepts/Recursion/6.Factorial.cpp" target="_blank">Code2</a> ]</summary> 
   <blockquote>
      
      // Tail Recursion takes less time for in modern compilers
      // Reason ?
      // Because of execution flow, as it is tail recursive.
      // Tail Recursive: A function is called tail recursive when parent function has nothing more to
      //                 do when the child function is finished
      //                                or
      //                 A function is called tail recursive when the last thing that happens in that
      //                 function is a recursive call.
      //
      // So, because of this Execution is faster because caller doesn't have to save the state as nothing
      // is going to get implemented after reclusion call.
      // So, modern compiler does a little optimization here:
      //  void printNto1(int n)
      //  {
      //     .....
      //     .....
      //     cout << n << " ";
      //     printNto1(n - 1);  ===> they changes this to
      //  }

      //  this:-

      //  void printNto1(int n)
      //  {
      //     start:
      //     .....
      //     .....
      //     cout << n << " ";
      //     n = n-1;
      //     goto start;
      //  }

      // So, they remove recursion completely => No Auxillary space requirement => SC: O(N) -> theta(1)
      //  => if this optimization was not done, then we would've need O(N) aux space for recursive calls,
      //     need to save the states of function and then need to resume for those states, but now with
      //     that Optimization all that overhead is Gone.

      // Those above Changes which Modern compilers make is called "Tail call Elimination"
      // So, Always prefer Tail reclusive solutions as they are more optimized

      // Tail Recursive
      void printNto1(int n)
      {
         if (n == 0)
            return;

         cout << n << " ";
         printNto1(n - 1);
      }

      // Not Tail recursive
      void print1toN(int n)
      {
         if (n == 0)
            return;

         print1toN(n - 1);
         cout << n << " ";
      }

      // Now, can we change function to Tail recursive if they are not ?
      // See above function print1toN() it's not tail recursive. let's make it Tail reclusive:

      void print1toN_TailRecursive(int n, int k = 1)
      {
         // we can pass k=1 initially too instead of taking as default value
         if (n == 0)
            return;

         cout << k << " ";
         print1toN_TailRecursive(n - 1, k + 1);
      }

      // NOTE: We can't convert every Non tail recursive function to Tail Reclusive function
      // eg:
      //    1. Merge sort (not tail recursive) & Quick sort (tail recursive).
      //       That's also one of the reason why Quick Sort is Fast.
      //    2. In Tree Traversals Pre-order, In-order traversal are tail recursive but Post order traversal is not.
      //       that's why in interviews prefer Pre or In order traversal if can apply instead or post order traversal.
      //       eg: when finding sum of all the nodes in a tree
      //    3. factorial function isn't tail recursive by default but we can make it tail reclusive. see in Code2 or 6.Factorial.cpp

<summary> About XOR [ <a href="/Basic-Concepts/Bit Manipulation" target="_blank">Codes</a> ]</summary>


#### ABOUT XOR (^) Operator:

    
    1. XOR of 2 Same = 0
    2. XOR of 2 Different = 1
        eg: 1^0 = 1
            0^1 = 1
            1^1 = 0
            0^0 = 0
    3. If there are multiple values getting XORed:
          - if number of 1 is odd => 1 (ans)
          - if number of 1 is even => 0 (ans)
        eg: 1^1^0 = 0
            1^1^1^0 = 1
            1^1^1 = 1
            1^1^1^1 = 0
            0^0^0^0 = 0

        Similarly:
            - XOR of same number even number of times => 0 (ans)
            - XOR of same number Odd number of times => same number (ans)
        eg: 4^4^0 = 0
            4^4^4 = 4
            4^4^4^0 = 4
            4^4^4^4 = 0
