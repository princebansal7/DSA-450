/*
In circular linked list, last node's next contains the address of 1st node
Hence, if head pointer points to 1st node then operations like insertion and
deletion at 1st and last node becomes costlier as we had to make changes in
last node too (comparing to singly linked list). But the amount of memory
consumed is same.

=> so why circular linked list ?
   if we make a little change, and instead of 'head' pointer pointing to 1st node,
   if now it points to last node, then, above mostly operations becomes O(1)
   i.e, more efficient.
